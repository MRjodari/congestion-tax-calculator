# Congestion Tax Calculator

I finished it less than 4 hours, but some refactories was needed.
1. Are traffic tax laws changing rapidly?
2.Isn't it easier to issue the tax amount online than to calculate the total daily or weekly amount?
3.Is there a need to record the traffic information of each car during the course?
4.Why is the very low version of .NET selected for this test?
